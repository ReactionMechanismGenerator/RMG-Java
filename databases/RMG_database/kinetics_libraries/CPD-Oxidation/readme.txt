The cited reference lists QRRK reactions that end in radicals that react in other parts of their mechanism. The QRRK reactions are listed in pdepreactions.txt. 

Supplementary high pressure limits are listed in reactions.txt, but not all reactions from the reference are listed because some would overlap.

In the current iteration of RMG, the described scheme only works if the library is submitted as a seed mechanism because pdepreactions.txt is not handled correctly for reaction libraries.
