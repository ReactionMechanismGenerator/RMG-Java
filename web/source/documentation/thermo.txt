Estimating Species Thermochemistry
**********************************

The ``ThermoDataEstimator`` utility produces group additivity-based thermochemistry estimates without running RMG. As with the thermochemistry estimates used by RMG, the ``ThermoDataEstimator`` utility bases its estimates on group values located in the RMG database.

Instructions for Use
--------------------

1. Create a text file named :file:`input.txt` in any directory that you like.  
   The text file should begin with a block to specify the desired Database.
   
   The next section allows to use on-the-fly generation QM techniques to estimate TD
   properties, rather than group additivity methods.
   
   The first flag activates the use of QM methods (set flag to true):
   e.g.:
   	//QM?
   	false
   
   The QM package to be used, is specified: either choose "both", "gaussian03", "mopac", 
   "mm4", or "mm4hr"
   e.g.:  
   	//method
   	gaussian03
   
   Limit the use of on-the-fly methods to only cyclic species with the following flag 
   (set to true)
   e.g.:
   	//ForCyclicsOnly?
   	true
   
   Limit the use of on-the-fly methods to only species with less than the specified number
   of unpaired electrons. E.g. "0", implies that radical species will not computed using
   on-the-fly QM methods.
   e.g.:
   	//maxradnumforQM?
   	0  
   
   The next section allows the user to set atom constraints on the species to be processed
   by the ThermoDataEstimator, beyond the default values hard-coded in TDE. 
   Only species that satisfy the set atom constraints, will be processed by TDE.
   Uncomment (//) the desired atom constraint, to set a particular constraint.
   
   E.g.:
   	MaxCarbonNumberPerSpecies:     40
   	//MaxOxygenNumberPerSpecies:     10
   	//MaxRadicalNumberPerSpecies:    10
   	//MaxSulfurNumberPerSpecies:     10
   	//MaxSiliconNumberPerSpecies:    10
   	//MaxHeavyAtomNumberPerSpecies: 100
   	//MaxCycleNumberPerSpecies:      10
   	END 
   
   The next field should be the PrimaryThermoLibrary, which may be left empty if desired:

	Database: RMG_database
	
	PrimaryThermoLibrary:
	END

   Next, in the text file, create the adjacency list(s) corresponding to the molecule(s) of interest using the same syntax used to define a species in the :file:`condition.txt` input file (see RMG manual). Hydrogens can be omitted for simplicity. For example, the adjacency list for 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane could be written as::

	1 C 0 {2,S}
	2 C 0 {1,S} {3,S} {4,S} {5,S}
	3 C 0 {2,S}
	4 C 0 {2,S}
	5 C 0 {2,S} {6,S}
	6 C 0 {5,S} {7,S} {8,S} {9,S}
	7 C 0 {6,S}
	8 C 0 {6,S}
	9 C 0 {6,S}

2. At the command prompt, change directory to the location of the :file:`input.txt` file and then, if you are using a unix-based operating system, execute the command ::

	 $ java -classpath $RMG/bin/RMG.jar ThermoDataEstimator input.txt > RMG.log

   Or if you are using a Windows operating system you can instead run the batch file :file:`ThermoDataEstimator.bat`. Either double-click it or at the command propmpt type::

     > ThermoDataEstimator.bat

  The output of the program will automatically be written to :file:`RMG.log`

3. The program will read RMG's thermodynamics database, count groups, and output the NASA polynomials in CHEMKIN format, as well as another set of values labeled ThermoData. The format for ThermoData is

	ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` S\ :sub:`298` C\ :sub:`p,300` C\ :sub:`p,400` C\ :sub:`p,500` C\ :sub:`p,600` C\ :sub:`p,800` C\ :sub:`p,1000` C\ :sub:`p,1500`

   Units are kcal/mol for ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` and cal/mol*K for the other quantities (entropy and heat capacity). The symmetry number (including contributions from internal rotations) will also be displayed.
