Installing on MacOS X
*************************

This section is for users who wish to install RMG on `MacOS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) <store.apple.com/snow-leopard>`_.
Other versions of MacOS X will be similar, but have not been tested.

Dependencies
------------

To install RMG on a MacOS X system, you must first install the following

MacOS XCode Developer Tools
    These are included on the install DVD that came with your Mac, or you can
    download them from Apple at http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/
    (after free registration). This includes all the build tools you will
    need, and versions of the BLAS and LAPACK optimized for high performance
    vector and numerical computing.
    
A Fortran compiler
    We recommend `gfortran <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ from the free
    GNU Compiler Collection. One nice way to get gfortran is to install the
    `homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_ package manager, then then
    type ``brew install gfortran`` in a terminal. Alternatively, get the
    version from http://r.research.att.com/tools/ (`download universal binary
    <http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-4.2.3.dmg>`_).
    
    `g95 <http://www.g95.org/>`_ is another free 
    compiler that is known to work, if you prefer.


Compiling From Source
---------------------

.. note:: Quick start for impatient people::

   $ git clone git://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java.git
   $ cd RMG-Java
   $ git checkout 3.3
   $ make MACOS=true
   $ make test
   $ echo "export RMG=`pwd`" >> ~/.bashrc

More detailed instructions:

#. If you have not already done so, download the RMG source code using one
   of the methods described on the :ref:`downloading RMG
   <installation_downloading>` page.

#. Unpack the RMG source code (if necessary) and move it to the desired 
   installation directory, such as an :file:`RMG-Java` directory inside
   your Home directory.

#. Set the ``RMG`` environment variable to the path of your desired
   installation directory. As an example, let us say you placed the RMG
   package files at :file:`/Users/yourname/RMG-Java`. Open a `Terminal
   <http://macapper.com/2007/03/08/the-terminal-an-introduction/>`_ window and
   type the command ::
    
   $ export RMG=/Users/yourname/RMG-Java
   
   To avoid typing this line each time you open a Terminal window, append it to your :file:`~/.bashrc` 
   file, by typing::
   
   $ echo "export RMG=/Users/yourname/RMG-Java" >> ~/.bashrc
   
   This will cause the ``RMG``
   variable to be automatically set each time you start a Terminal window in the
   future.

#. From the root of the RMG installation directory, run ``make MACOS=true`` to compile
   RMG. This will compile all of the Fortran dependencies and the main Java
   executable. ::
   
   $ cd $RMG
   $ make MACOS=true
    
   If you are using ``g95`` instead of ``gfortran``, use this version of the
   ``make`` command instead::
   
   $ make F90=g95
   
   You can also compile the Java code independently by running the following
   from the root RMG installation directory::
   
   $ ant jar

   If all of the above steps were completed successfully, then you should have a
   working version of RMG ready for use. You should see several executables and
   one JAR file appear in the ``$RMG/bin`` folder.
  
#. To test that RMG is working, simply type::

   $ make test

   Or you can try to run one of the other examples, such as 
   the "minimal" example, via commands similar to ::
   
   $ cd $RMG/examples/RMG/minimal
   $ java -jar $RMG/bin/RMG.jar condition.txt
   
Now that you have a working version of RMG, you may wish to install some of the
:ref:`optional features <installation_optional>`. Once you are ready to run
RMG, continue to learning how to create RMG input files, either 
:ref:`by hand <conditionfile>` or via the 
:ref:`graphical user interface <GraphicalUserInterface>`.
