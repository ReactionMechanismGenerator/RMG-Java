Windows Installer Package
=========================

An installer is available for Windows users which provides RMG binaries and
source code and automatically performs other installation tasks. This is the
easiest method for RMG installation on Windows. Get the Windows installer
at

.. admonition:: Download

    `RMG 4.0 Installer for Windows <http://sourceforge.net/projects/rmg/files/rmg/RMG%204.0/rmg-4.0-win32-setup.exe/download>`_ (32-bit only)

The installer provides a 32-bit version of RMG. You must compile RMG yourself 
to obtain 64-bit versions of the binaries.

For help with the installation on Windows, please refer to the 
:ref:`installation_windows` section.

Source Code
===========

There are three ways of obtaining the RMG source package. For all cases,
installation instructions are available for 
:ref:`Windows <installation_windows>`, :ref:`Linux <installation_linux>`,
and :ref:`Mac OS <installation_mac>`.

Stable Release
--------------

A tarball of the most recent stable release can be downloaded here:

.. admonition:: Download

    `RMG 4.0 Source Package <http://sourceforge.net/projects/rmg/files/rmg/RMG%204.0/rmg-4.0-source.tar.gz/download>`_ (all platforms)
   
The above package is suitable for all platforms.

Latest Snapshot
---------------

The RMG development repository is publicly available on GitHub at

   http://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/

To get the latest development version of the source code -- in git parlance,
the head of the official master branch -- you can download a snapshot from

   http://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/archives/master

Version Control
---------------

If you'd like to stay up-to-date with the latest development version as it
evolves, you can use either git or subversion to checkout the latest version
from our official repository. For git (recommended), use the command ::

$ git clone git://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java.git

For subversion, use the command ::

$ svn checkout http://svn.github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java.git RMG-Java

This gives you read-only access. If you might want to make changes, a better 
idea is to create your own account on `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_, fork 
the official repository, and clone from your fork. More information on how to
do this is available at http://help.github.com/.
