Running RMG from the Command Line in Linux
==========================================

This section assumes that RMG is already installed according to the directions
in Section :ref:`Linux installation <installation_linux>`. Additionally, it is assumed that you have
created a directory (either in your home directory or elsewhere) in which the
initialization file :file:`condition.txt` has been placed. In the example, we
assume that we have created a directory :file:`/hexane_pyro`, which contains the
condition file :file:`hexane_pyro.txt`.

#. Change the current working directory to the directory with the condition
   file::

    $ cd /hexane_pyro/

#. Run the following Java command to launch the program
   (all one line)::

    $ java -Xmx500m -classpath $RMG/bin/RMG.jar RMG hexane_pyro.txt

When RMG is started, it creates several subdirectories: :file:`2Dmolfiles`, :file:`3Dmolfiles`, :file:`chemkin`,
:file:`fame`, :file:`frankie`, :file:`GATPFit`, :file:`InChI`,
:file:`ODESolver`, :file:`Pruning`, :file:`QMfiles` and :file:`Restart`.
By default these are in the directory from which you ran the command, but to
configure them see :ref:`configuringpaths`.


In this example, all of the output from RMG is piped to a file :file:`output.log`. The ``> output``
part of the command is optional but recommended.
The Java option ``-Xmx500m`` is hardware specific. In this example, we assume that
we can allot five hundred megabytes of memory for Java Virtual Machine running
RMG; please consult a guide to Java for more information.
On unix systems we recommend allocating less than half of your available virtual memory, because of
the way the Java Virtual Machine forks processes.

To see the content of
the output file as it is being generated, use the command:  ``$ tail -f output.log``.


.. _runninginwindows:

Running RMG from the Command Line in Windows
============================================

To run RMG in Windows: Open a DOS-prompt, change the current working directory to the directory with the condition file, and run the following Java command to launch the program.  In this example, the condition file is located in a (new) folder named conditionFiles::

	cd "%rmg%"\conditionFiles
	java -Xmx500m -jar "%rmg%"\bin\RMG.jar condition.txt
	
.. note::

	The name of the input file does not have to be :file:`condition.txt`.

A log file containing the same information printed to the console, plus additional details, is automatically saved for you to ``RMG.log`` in the same directory as the condition file. Redirection of stdout to a file is no longer required.
	
Running RMG using Batch Scripts in Windows
==========================================

As of version 3.2, several batch scripts have been provided to make running RMG on Windows more straightforward. These can be found along with the example condition files in the ``examples`` directory. There are currently three such scripts:

* ``RMG.bat`` - For running general RMG mechanism generation jobs

* ``PopulateReactions.bat`` - For generating possible reactions and kinetics of a set of species

* ``ThermoDataEstimator.bat`` - For estimating the thermodynamics of a set of species

The easiest way to use them is:

1. Create the condition or input file for the job you wish to run. For general RMG jobs this file should be named ``condition.txt``. For other jobs this file should be named ``input.txt``.

2. Copy the batch script corresponding to the job you wish to run to the folder containing the condition file. For best results, this folder should only contain the condition file and the batch script at this step. The batch script will happily overwrite existing files if they correspond to files created by RMG, including the results of a previous RMG run.

3. Double-click the batch script to start the job. A console window will appear. After a few seconds a line of text should appear that tells you the job has been started. If RMG is not setup correctly, an error message will appear instead telling you what needs to be done. As the job runs, output will be sent to the file ``RMG.log`` in the same directory as the condition file.

4. Close the console window when the job is finished. The batch script will print a line of text when the job is completed. This line of text does not reflect whether or not the job was successful; check the tail of ``RMG.log`` for that information.

.. note::

	You can edit the batch script file using a program like Notepad if you want to change thing like the filenames or memory allocation.

.. _configuringpaths:

Configuring paths using Environment Variables
=============================================

You can control where a lot of output and temporary files are stored by manipulating
environment variables before running RMG. This can be useful for running on networked
clusters of computers, eg. for running several jobs concurrently that can share the
same quantum mechanics calculations results, or for saving your temporary scratch
files on a local (fast) hard disk, and your final results on a shared network drive.

An example bash script provided in the 1,3-hexadiene example directory, demonstrates
the variables and their default values:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/RMG/1,3-hexadiene/RMG.sh

The same approach should work for Windows.

You can also pass the variables when you call the program, eg::

$ RMG_QM_LIBRARY=$HOME/myQMlibrary java -Xmx500m -classpath $RMG/bin/RMG.jar RMG condition.txt
