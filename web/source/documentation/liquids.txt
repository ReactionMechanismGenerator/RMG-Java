Liquid Phase Systems
********************

To simulate liquids in RMG requires three components.


After the ``PressureModel`` line in the :file:`condition.txt` input file, add a section like this::

    EquationOfState: Liquid
    Solvation: on octane
    Diffusion: on 1.0e-3


Equation of state
------------------
The first statement
``EquationOfState: Liquid``
will have two effects:

#. disable the ideal gas law renormalization and instead rely on the concentrations you specified in the input file to initialize the system.
#. prevent the volume from changing when there is a net stoichiometry change due to a chemical reaction (A = B + C). 


Solvation thermochemistry
--------------------------

The next correction for liquids is solvation effects on the thermochemistry. 
The method used is described briefly in 
"Building Models of Liquid Phase Kinetics and Separation: Hydrocarbon Autoxidation", Richard H. West, Amrit Jalan, and William H. Green,
`AIChE Annual Meeting <http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2010/webprogram/Paper200216.html>`_, 2010 (`download pdf <http://web.mit.edu/rwest/www/Richard%20West%20AIChE%20Extended%20Abstract%20153g.pdf>`_)

The statement ``Solvation: on <solvent>`` turns this on, and specifies the solvent parameters to use.
Parameters are provided for the following solvents: 
acetonitrile
benzene
butanol
carbontet
chloroform
cyclohexane
decane
dibutylether
dichloroethane
dimethylformamide
dimethylsulfoxide
dodecane
ethanol
ethylacetate
heptane
hexadecane
hexane
isooctane
nonane
octane
octanol
pentane
toluene
undecane
water.


Diffusion-limited kinetics
---------------------------
The next correction for liquid-phase reactions is to ensure that bimolecular reactions do not exceed their diffusion limits.
The diffusivity is estimated for each species using a Stokes-Einstein hard sphere model.
The viscosity of the solvent is specified in units of Pa.s using the command
``Diffusion: on <viscosity>``

To build accurate models of liquid phase chemical reactions you will also want to modify your kinetics libraries.


Example liquid-phase condition file
-------------------------------------
This is an example of a small condition file for a liquid-phase system:
