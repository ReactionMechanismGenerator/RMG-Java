//This is an example illustrating the use of on-the-fly thermo
//calculations. Gaussian03 is used to estimate thermodynamic
//properties of cyclic species, like cyclopropane. In particular,
//the semi-empirical PM3 method, with RRHO treatment of partition
//functions is used. Without this feature, RMG would try to estimate
//thermodynamic properties of cyclic species using the typical Benson
//groups, and would only apply an appropriate ad hoc ring correction
//if it is in Ring_Library.txt. The example should take roughly 45
//minutes to run and requires several additional dependencies, as
//described in the documentation.
